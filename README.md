In the second video of our 2d platformer series, we'll implement animations and
build our first proper test level with a tilemaplayer. we'll also configure the
camera to better follow our character.

### [Assetlib introduction & plugin recommendations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF-AZ3ulJlU&list=PLS_-svNHQV8gn-3NtT7kWB6jKIlaJ2nBd&index=3)
